This is a Thinkful assignment on Web Apps

There are multiple JS scripts attached to the html file (at the bottom). The ones not used are commented out. Go ahead and comment them in to see how they work.

The three scripts are:
-displayInConsole:- This lets the user choose between 1-50 random dog images. The result(s) print to the console.

-displayInDOM:- Like the previous one, it lets the user choose between 1-50 random dog images. But displays them in the DOM

-displayBreed:- This one displays a random image of a breed the user chooses.
